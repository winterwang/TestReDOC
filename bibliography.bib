  abstract = {The latent class (LC) models that have been developed so far assume that observations are independent. Parametric and nonparametric random–coefficient LC models are proposed here, which will make it possible to modify this assumption. For example, the models can be used for the analysis of data collected with complex sampling designs, data with a multilevel structure, and multiple–group data for more than a few groups. An adapted EM algorithm is presented that makes maximum–likelihood estimation feasible. The new model is illustrated with examples from organizational, educational, and cross–national comparative research.},

  abstract   = {BackgroundPrevious studies have suggested that shift work is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the quantitative dose?response relationship between duration of shift work and cardiovascular disease risk is still unknown. We aimed to evaluate the dose?response association between duration of shift work and risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.DesignA systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsPubMed and Embase were searched from inception to 1 December 2017. Prospective cohort studies that reported the associations between duration of shift work and cardiovascular disease risk with at least three categories were included. Data were pooled by using fixed or random effect models. The continuous dose?response associations were assessed by using fixed effect restricted cubic splines with four knots.ResultsFive prospective cohort studies with 10 reports were included. No evidence of a curvilinear association was observed between duration of shift work and risk of cardiovascular disease, similar findings were observed in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The summary relative risk (RR) of an increase of 5 years of shift work was 1.05 (1.04?1.07) with moderate heterogeneity (P?=?0.142, I2?=?33.2\%) for cardiovascular disease, 1.06 (1.04?1.08) with low heterogeneity (P?=?0.279, I2?=?21.7\%) for cardiovascular disease morbidity, and 1.04 (1.02?1.06) with moderate heterogeneity (P?=?0.135, I2?=?38.5\%) for cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively.ConclusionsShift work could probably increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality in a dose?response way. These findings could have implications for guideline recommendations regarding the risk related to shift schedules.},

  abstract   = {Summary
Background
The relationship between macronutrients and cardiovascular disease and mortality is controversial. Most available data are from European and North American populations where nutrition excess is more likely, so their applicability to other populations is unclear.
Methods
The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study is a large, epidemiological cohort study of individuals aged 35\textendash{}70 years (enrolled between Jan 1, 2003, and March 31, 2013) in 18 countries with a median follow-up of 7$\cdot$4 years (IQR 5$\cdot$3\textendash{}9$\cdot$3). Dietary intake of 135\hphantom{,}335 individuals was recorded using validated food frequency questionnaires. The primary outcomes were total mortality and major cardiovascular events (fatal cardiovascular disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure). Secondary outcomes were all myocardial infarctions, stroke, cardiovascular disease mortality, and non-cardiovascular disease mortality. Participants were categorised into quintiles of nutrient intake (carbohydrate, fats, and protein) based on percentage of energy provided by nutrients. We assessed the associations between consumption of carbohydrate, total fat, and each type of fat with cardiovascular disease and total mortality. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using a multivariable Cox frailty model with random intercepts to account for centre clustering.
Findings
During follow-up, we documented 5796 deaths and 4784 major cardiovascular disease events. Higher carbohydrate intake was associated with an increased risk of total mortality (highest [quintile 5] vs lowest quintile [quintile 1] category, HR 1$\cdot$28 [95\% CI 1$\cdot$12\textendash{}1$\cdot$46], ptrend=0$\cdot$0001) but not with the risk of cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality. Intake of total fat and each type of fat was associated with lower risk of total mortality (quintile 5 vs quintile 1, total fat: HR 0$\cdot$77 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$67\textendash{}0$\cdot$87], ptrend$<$0$\cdot$0001; saturated fat, HR 0$\cdot$86 [0$\cdot$76\textendash{}0$\cdot$99], ptrend=0$\cdot$0088; monounsaturated fat: HR 0$\cdot$81 [0$\cdot$71\textendash{}0$\cdot$92], ptrend$<$0$\cdot$0001; and polyunsaturated fat: HR 0$\cdot$80 [0$\cdot$71\textendash{}0$\cdot$89], ptrend$<$0$\cdot$0001). Higher saturated fat intake was associated with lower risk of stroke (quintile 5 vs quintile 1, HR 0$\cdot$79 [95\% CI 0$\cdot$64\textendash{}0$\cdot$98], ptrend=0$\cdot$0498). Total fat and saturated and unsaturated fats were not significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular disease mortality.
Interpretation
High carbohydrate intake was associated with higher risk of total mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to lower total mortality. Total fat and types of fat were not associated with cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease mortality, whereas saturated fat had an inverse association with stroke. Global dietary guidelines should be reconsidered in light of these findings.
