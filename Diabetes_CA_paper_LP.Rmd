INTRODUCTION
------------

The timing of energy intake has been shown to be associated with obesity and
diabetes. [@almoosawi2016chrono] Specifically, eating late at night or having a
late dinner was found to be related to higher risk of obesity
[@xiao2019meal;@yoshida2018association], hyperglycemia [@nakajima2015association], metabolic syndrome
[@kutsuma2014potential], diabetes [@mattson2014meal], and poorer glycemic
control among diabetics [@sakai2017late]. However, the relationship
between food choice and [their time of being consumed during]{.deletion
author="Luigi Palla" date="2021-01-18T13:00:00Z"} the time of [food consumption
during the]{.insertion author="Luigi Palla" date="2021-01-18T13:00:00Z"} day is
left largely unknown. Shiftworkers have an increased risk of obesity
[@balieiro2014nutritional;@barbadoro2013rotating], and diabetes [@pan2011rotating], probably due to
limited availability of healthy food choice during their night shifts
[@bonnell2017influences;@balieiro2014nutritional]. Identifying those unhealthy foods that might be chosen
during late night time would be helpful when guiding people to change their
eating habit for the purpose of either weight losing or maintaining glycemic
control. Dietary diary recordings from national surveys [can]{.insertion

6802 adults (2810 men and 3992 women) and 749026 food recordings collected by
the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP 2008-17)
were analyzed in the current study [@MRCElsieWiddowsonLaboratory2018]. The sample was
randomly drawn from a list of all addresses in the UK, clustered into postcode
sectors. Details of the rationale, design and methods of the survey can be found
in the previous published reports [@bates2014national; @roberts2018national]. Time of the day was
categorized [in]{.insertion author="Luigi Palla"

pm, and 10 pm - 6 am. Foods recorded were classified into 60 standard food
groups with 1 to 10 subgroups each: the details are given in Appendix R of the
NDNS offical report [@NDNSdatabase2018]. We focused on the 60 standard food
groups in the current analysis. [I think here you need to clarify which data are

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The present study described the potential relationships between food groups and
time of their consumption in a representative sample from the NDNS RP. All
unhealthy foods emerged from CA were found to be more likely to be consumed
after 8 pm. These included alcoholic/sweetened beverages, chocolates and other
foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats such as biscuits and ice cream.
Foods chosen in the evening/night time slots tend to be highly processed and
easily accessible. Specifically, undiagnosed patients might be at a higher risk
of worsening their condition as they were found to have higher odds to choose a
number of less healthy foods after 8 pm (sugar confectioneries, regular soft
drinks) compared to earlier time than diabetics and non-diabetics. Those food
might need to be targeted when designing intervention to those who might be at
risk of being diabetics[, also in terms of]{.insertion author="Luigi Palla"

However, higher odds of consuming alcoholic beverages and energy condensed foods
such as chocolates and sugar confectioneries at night among diabetics suggested
that their food choice might need further modifications. [ ]{.insertion
