\begin{abstract}

Time of eating has been shown to be associated with diabetes and obesity but little is known about less healthy foods and specific time of their intake over the 24 hours of the day. In this study we aimed to identify potential relationships between foods and their eating time, and see whether these associations may vary by diabetes status. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) including 6802 adults (age $\geq$ 19 years old) collected 749,026 food recordings by a 4-day-diary. The contingency table cross-classifying 60 food groups with 7 pre-defined eating time slots (6-9am, 9am-12pm, 12-2pm, 2-5pm, 8-10pm, 10pm-6am) was analyzed by Correspondence Analysis (CA). CA biplots displaying the associations were generated for all adults and separately by diabetes status (self-reported, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed-diabetes, and non-diabetics) to visually explore the associations between food groups and time of eating across diabetes strata. For selected food groups, odds ratios (OR, 99\% confidence intervals, CI) were derived of consuming unhealthy foods at evening/night (8pm-6am) vs. earlier time in the day, by logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations. The biplots suggested positive associations between evening/night and consumption of puddings, regular soft drinks, sugar confectioneries, chocolates,  beers, ice cream, biscuits, and crisps for all adults in the UK. The OR (99\% CIs) of consuming these foods at evening/night were respectively 1.43 (1.06, 1.94), 1.72 (1.44, 2.05), 1.84 (1.31, 2.59), 3.08 (2.62, 3.62), 7.26 (5.91, 8.92), 2.45 (1.84, 3.25), 1.90 (1.68, 2.16), 1.49 (1.22, 1.82) vs. earlier time in the day adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and social-economic levels. Stratified biplots found that sweetened beverages, sugar-confectioneries appeared more strongly associated with evening/night among un-diagnosed diabetics. Foods consumed in the evening/night time tend to be highly processed, easily accessible, and rich in added sugar or saturated fat. Individuals with undiagnosed diabetes are more likely to consume unhealthy foods at night. Further longitudinal studies are required to ascertain the causal direction of the association between late-eating and diabetes status.

# Introduction {-}

The timing of energy intake has been shown to be associated with obesity and diabetes. [@almoosawi2016chrono] Specifically, eating late at night or having a late dinner was found to be related to higher risk of obesity [@xiao2019meal; @yoshida2018association], hyperglycemia [@nakajima2015association], metabolic syndrome [@kutsuma2014potential], diabetes [@mattson2014meal], and poorer glycemic control among diabetics [@sakai2017late]. However, the relationship between food choice and the time of food consumption during the day is left largely unknown. Shiftworkers have an increased risk of obesity [@balieiro2014nutritional; @barbadoro2013rotating], and diabetes [@pan2011rotating], possibly due to limited availability of healthy food choice during their night shifts [@bonnell2017influences; @balieiro2014nutritional]. Previous survey data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP) found that overall, 3.4% of men and 2.3% of women aged 19-64 had fasting glucose concentrations above the clinical cut-off for diabetes ($\geqslant$ 7 mmol/L). Moreover, the proportion of men with undiagnosed diabetes increased with age to over 20% in the UK population [@almoosawi2014biomarkers]. Identifying those unhealthy foods that might be chosen during late night time would be helpful when guiding people to change their eating habit for the purpose of either weight loss or glycemic control. Dietary diary recordings from NDNS RP surveys can provide detailed food choice data for exploration of the relationships between food groups and their time of consumption in the general population.

In this study, we aimed to describe the relationship between food groups and the time of day when they were consumed, and how such relationships may vary by status of type 2 diabetes using the data published by the NDNS RP from 2008 to 2017 as this survey includes diet diaries providing detailed information on the time of day of food intake.


# Methods {-}

6802 adults (2810 men and 3992 women) and 749026 food recordings collected by the NDNS RP 2008-17 were analyzed in the current study [@MRCElsieWiddowsonLaboratory2018]. The survey comprised a cross-section representative sample of the UK adult population taken over the period 2008-2017.  The sample was randomly drawn from a list of all addresses in the UK, clustered into postcode sectors. Details of the rationale, design and methods of the survey can be found in the previously published official study reports [@bates2014national;@roberts2018national]. A four-day food diary method was used in the NDNS RP to collect the detailed food items and their time of consumption from participants. Comparison between the food diary method and a repeated 24-hour recall questionnaire was performed in a subset of study sample prior to the launch of the NDNS RP in 2008 and found that they were similar in terms of response rate as well as the ability to collect correct nutrition intake data. And the four-day food diary methos was adopted because it is considered to be more flexible and adaptable to cover wide population age range in the survey. More details can be found in the Appendix A of the official NDNS RP study report [@bates2014national;@roberts2018national]. Furthermore, the same food diary methods is actually used in large studies conducted in the UK, such as the the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (1946 British Birth Cohort) [@price1997characteristics], the EPIC Norfolk Study [@bingham2001nutritional], the UK Women’s Cohort Study in Leeds [@cade2004uk], and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort [@glynn2005food].

In the food diary recordings, time of the day was categorized into 7 slots: 6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8-10 pm and 10 pm - 6 am. Foods recorded were classified into 60 standard food groups with 1 to 10 subgroups each: the details are given in Appendix R of the NDNS official report [@NDNSdatabase2018]. We focused on the 60 standard food groups in the current analysis. Diabetes status was defined as: 1) healthy if fasting glucose was lower than 6.10 (mmol/L), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was less than 6.5 (\%), and without self-reported diabetes and treatment for diabetes (n = 2626); 2) pre-diabetic if fasting glucose was lower between 6.10 and 6.99 (mmol/L, inclusive) but without self-reported diabetes and without treatment for diabetes (n = 133); 3) undiagnosed diabetic if either fasting glucose was higher or equal to 7.00 (mmol/L) or HbA1c higher or equal to 6.5 (\%) but without self-reported diabetes and treatment for diabetes (n = 99); 4) diabetic if participant had self-reported diabetes or was under treatment for diabetes (n = 227). Consequently, there was also a large number of adults (3717 adults of whom 1519 men and 2198 women) whose diabetes status did not fall in one of above categories and could not thus be confirmed; these were retained in the whole sample (unstratified) analyses. In addition, the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification [@rose2005national] was applied in the survey and accordingly, the socio-economic status of participants  was classified in one of 8 categories. 


Correspondence analysis (CA) [@greenacre2017correspondence;@Chapman2017;@palla2020adolescents] was used as a tool for data mining, visualization and hypotheses generation using half of the randomly selected NDNS diary entries data. Specifically, the contingency table generated by cross-tabulating 60 food groups and 7 time slots were analyzed by CA. Through CA, the 60 categories of standard foods and the 7 time slots were projected on biplots, i.e. onto two dimensional plots that could jointly contain large percentage of the $\chi^2$ deviation (or inertia) of the contingency table. Biplots that graphically show the association between time of day and food groups were derived for all adults and separately according to their diabetes status. CA is a statistical technique to explore relationships between categorical variables in a two-dimensional contingency table. In the current analysis context, CA is the technique to flag up those food groups that have a similar or differed “profile” among many categories. The “profile” means the relative frequency of the consumption of one food across different time in the day (or, symmetrically, the relative frequency of consumption of different foods at one specific time period). One simple example is that if about 77.8% of all foods were consumed during the day time (earlier than 8 pm), but only 23.5% of beer consumption were recorded during the day time, then we say beer has a time “profile” different from the average food profile. CA can produce biplots to visually show the chi-square deviation (inertia) of food (and time) profiles from the average profile. These biplots use the first two most informative dimensions to show the inertia of the contingency table. The horizontal axis of the biplot represents the direction along which the contingency table rows and columns show their greatest deviations. The vertical axis represents the direction, perpendicular to the first, having the second largest deviations. There are two percentage labels for each axis which indicate how much of the total inertia were explained along that axis. The sum of the two percentages is lower than 100%, the remaining inertia cannot be shown when reducing to 2 dimensions. The origin in each biplot is the average profile of all points in the plot, while the length of the vector from origin to each profile point represents its deviation from the average profile. The distance between row (food) and column (time slots) profile points and the direction in which they lie away from the origin is indicating that they are associated with each other. The potential association is greater if points are located in similar directions and away from the origin.

To account for the hierarchical structure of the data (food recorded by the same individuals who lived within the same area/sampling units) and to calculate population average odds ratios (OR), logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations (GEE) were subsequently used to test the associations that were first suggested by visual inspection of biplots generated by CA, using the remaining half of the diary entries data. The marginal ORs and their 99\% confidence intervals (CI) were derived of consuming unhealthy food groups (selected by CA) later in the day (8 pm - 6 am, i.e. in the evening and night) compared to earlier in the day (in the morning or afternoon). CA and biplots were conducted and generated by the following packages under R environment [@Rcoreteam]: \texttt{FactoMineR, factoextra, ggplot2, ggrepel} [@L__2008;@factoextra;@ggplot2;@ggrepel] Logistic regression models with GEE were performed with SAS procedure \texttt{GENMOD} [@SAS94] adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socio-economic levels, which were deemed the main potential confounders of the associations. 


# Results {-}


The dataset consisted of 2810 (41.3\%) men and 3992 (58.7\%) women aged older than or equal to 19 years old with the mean age of 49.9 years (standard deviation, SD = 17.6). Of these individuals 22.6 \% were current smokers, 24.3 \% were past smokers. The average body mass index (BMI) was 27.7 kg/m$^2$ (SD = 5.41). Among the food recordings collected (n = 749026), 56.9\% were recorded during traditional breakfast (6 am - 9 am: 14.3\%), lunch (12 noon - 2 pm: 18.5\%), or dinner (5 pm - 8 pm: 24.1\%) time slots. Table 1. shows the top 37 food groups that contributed to 90\% of the total calories consumed by adults in NDNS RP. These food groups accounted for 478028 of the total diary entries (63.8 \%). The random process split the whole set of food recordings into a hypothesis generating dataset of 374682 and a testing dataset of 374344 entries. 


Figure 1-5 present the CA biplots that visually summarize the associations between 60 food groups and the time of their consumption in the entire sample and then stratifying by their diabetes status. In Figure 1, the horizontal axis explains 68.9 \% of the association structure (inertia) between food and time while the vertical axis reflects 15.3 \% of the same relationship. Therefore, a total of 84.2 \% of the inertia between food and time were captured in this figure which shows a visual summary of how those two categorical variables are related. Specifically, time slots later than 8 pm are shown in the upper side of the plot closer to alcoholic products (beers etc.) or highly processed/energy-dense foods (sugar confectioneries, chocolates, biscuits, regular softdrinks, ice cream, crisps); times earlier than noon appear in the left hand side together with typical breakfast foods (cereals, milk, bread, etc.).

To visualize the potentially different associational patterns between food groups choice and time slots according to diabetes status, Figure 2-5 display the CA biplots in subsets of the data. Depending on different diabetes status, these biplots explained between 76.3\% and 84.1\% of the inertia in the data. Similarly to the biplot created from the total sample (Figure 1), later time in the day (8 pm and later) are shown in the upper side of each figure and suggested an association with the alcoholic beverages and highly processed or energy-dense food groups. Additionally, some food groups and time slots also flagged up associations potentially different by diabetes status. For example, puddings seemed to be closer to later time in the day among undiagnosed diabetics (Figure 4) while for diagnosed diabetic patients (Figure 3) they were closer to traditional dinner time (5 pm to 8 pm) or earlier in the day. Furthermore, sugar confectioneries/chocolates/biscuits/regular soft drinks appeared to be associated with later time in the day (8 pm or later) more strongly among undiagnosed diabetics (Figure 4) than the other participants.

Based on the findings suggested from Figure 1-5, we decided to focus on puddings, regular soft drinks, confectioneries, chocolates, beers, ice cream, biscuits, crisps as these foods either showed a particularly strong association with time of the day or a different pattern of association across different strata of the survey sample; hence, we tested the following null hypotheses using logistic regression models (adjusted for age, sex, and socio-economic levels) with GEE: that the odds of consuming each selected food at later time of the day (8 pm - 6 am) is the same compared to earlier in the day; and the associations of the above-mentioned food groups and time slots are the same among participants with different diabetes status (i.e. no interaction between the time of food intake and diabetes status). The results are summarized in Table 2. 

The listed food groups were found to have higher odds to be consumed between 8 pm and 6 am with higher odds compared to earlier time. The OR (99\% CIs) main effects of consuming these foods at evening/night were for puddings 1.43 (1.06, 1.94), for regular soft drinks 1.72 (1.44, 2.05), for sugar confectioneries 1.84 (1.38, 2.69), for chocolates 3.08 (2.62, 3.62), for beers 7.26 (5.91, 8.92), for ice cream 2.45 (1.84, 3.25), for biscuits 1.90 (1.68, 2.16), for crisps 1.49 (1.22, 1.82) vs. earlier time. Opposite directions of the association for puddings were detected across diabetes status: the ORs (99\% CIs) of consuming puddings at night time (8 pm or later) compared to earlier time were 1.55 (1.13, 2.15),	0.95 (0.17, 5.20),	1.82 (0.41, 8.03), and	0.63 (0.15, 2.66) for healthy, prediabetic, undiagnosed diabetic, and diabetic participants, respectively. Furthermore, undiagnosed diabetic patients were found to have particularly high odds of consuming regular soft drinks (OR: 2.82; 99\% CI: 1.24, 6.43), and sugar confectioneries (OR: 10.61; 99\%CI: 2.35, 47.04) during night time periods compared to participants with other diabetes status. 


# Discussion {-}


The present study described the potential relationships between food groups and time of their consumption in a representative sample from the NDNS RP. Many unhealthy foods emerged from CA were found to be more likely to be consumed after 8 pm. These included alcoholic/sweetened beverages, chocolates and other foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats such as biscuits and ice cream. Foods chosen in the evening/night time slots tend to be highly processed and easily accessible. Specifically, undiagnosed patients might be at a higher risk of worsening their condition as they were found to have higher odds to choose a number of less healthy foods after 8 pm (sugar confectioneries, regular soft drinks) than diabetics and non-diabetics. Those foods might need to be targeted when designing intervention to those who might be at risk of being diabetics. 

These findings are concerning considering previous research that have indicated that quality of macronutrient intake in the evening is likely to influence fasting glucose levels and glycaemic response to subsequent meals in the morning. [@Wolever1988] More recently, a randomized controlled trial indicated that consuming carbohydrates at dinner irrespective of glycaemic index raised postprandial glucose response to breakfast producing what is known as a second meal effect [@Haldar2020]. Similar observation have been made by Nitta and colleagues who observed that eating sweet snacks post-dinner worsened glycaemic excursions in the evening and at subsequent breakfast [@Nitta2019]. Added to this is evidence that suggests that the late-night dinners induce post-prandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and that interventions at this eating occassions can result in a profound impact on post-prandial glycaemia. On the balance of this evidence, targeting and improving the timing and quality of foods in evening eating occasions provides a unique opportunity to design intervention to those who might be at risk of being diabetics. 


A compelling finding of our study is the observation that diabetes patients were found to be potentially controlling their choice of food groups such as avoiding puddings at night. However, higher odds of consuming alcoholic beverages and energy condensed foods such as chocolates and sugar confectioneries at night among individuals with diabetes suggests that their food choice might need further modifications. 

Assessing the relationships between food groups and timing of eating by diabetes status can be considered as a first step towards identifying specific public health targets for behavior change/intervention. This is important as most current public health strategies and dietary recommendations do not provide targeted advice that takes into considerations specific eating occasions while targeted advice is more likely to result in sustainable behavioural change. Our findings are consistent with previous evidence that has found that both sweetened and alcoholic beverages are responsible for large portion of energy consumption at night in other populations [@Hassen2018]. 


However, an important limitation in this study is the cross-sectional study design. The inability to assess the temporal relationship between timing of food intake and diabetes status means that a cause-effect relationship between time of unhealthy food intake and diabetes status cannot be established. Hence, further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the causal relationship between diabetes and both quality and timing of eating. Moreover, the current study assumes that mis-reporting occurred equally amongst all eating occasions. This limitation has been reported by previous literature as an important methodological limitation of chrononutrition [@FayetMoore2017]; in fact further investigation would be warranted to assess the effect of differential misreporting on epidemiological studies in chrono-nutrition in order to suggest possible corrections, e.g. for differential under-reporting at different times of the day (e.g. main meals vs. snack times). Finally, we did not include variables indicating abdominal obesity and sedentary lifestyle such as physical activity or waist circumference in the second step of the current analysis mainly due to missingness of the variables. The associations comparing food consumed later vs. earlier time in the day presented here may be partly explained or mediated through low level of physical activity and/or abdominal obesity especially among those who were unaware that they have diabetes (un-diagnosed diabetes), further detailed investigation is needed. 


# Conclusion {-}

In summary, our study indicates that foods consumed in the evening/night time tend to be highly processed, easily accessible, and rich in added sugar or saturated fat, whatever the diabetic status. . Individuals with undiagnosed diabetes are more likely to consume specific unhealthy foods at night. The survey cross-sectional nature warrants further investigations by longitudinal cohort studies to establish the causal relation between time of eating of unhealthy foods and diabetes.
