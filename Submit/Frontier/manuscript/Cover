Dear Editor
Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled "Relationships between food groups, eating time slots and diabetes status in adults from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008â€“2017)" submitted for publication as a Research Article.
 
Evidence has shown that timing of energy intake is associated with obesity and diabetes. Food group choice by time of consumption could probably explain this association but evidence is insufficient. We carefully conducted an exploratory analysis using the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey food diary data and found that unhealthy food groups that might be chosen during late night time and this association might be different by diabetes statuses. Targeting and improving the timing and food choice in evening occasions could provide a unique opportunity to design intervention to those who might be at risk of being diabetics. 

Our findings would interest your readership since we believe this is an important step forward to specific public health targets for behavior change/intervention as most current public health strategies and dietary recommendations do not provide targeted advice. 

Thanks for considering reviewing our paper for publication on your esteemed journal.
