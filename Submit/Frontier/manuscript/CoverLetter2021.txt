Dear Editor
Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled "Relationships between food groups, eating time slots according to diabetes status in adults from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008â€“2017)" submitted for publication as a Research Article.
 
Previous literature indicates that timing of energy intake is associated with obesity and diabetes. The examination of the association between food group choice and time of consumption within the day may contribute to explain this association but evidence presented so far has not focused on this as the resolution regarding foods and the time when they are eaten is often lacking in large surveys . Here we carefully conducted an exploratory analysis of such associations based on an approach previously used also to examine the context of eating (foods and timing), using the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey food diary data. We found that most unhealthy food groups tend to be consumed during late evening and night time and that strength of associations might even differ by diabetes status, with undiagnosed diabetics appearing to eat even some unhealthy foods later. Such findings suggest that targeting and improving the timing of food choice may be warranted, specifically designing interventions to those who might be at risk of being diabetics. Given that often dietary recommendations do not provide targeted advice, we believe that our article could interest your readership by bringing evidence to pave the way towards future targeted advice. 

Thanks for considering reviewing our paper for publication on your esteemed journal.

Your sincerely,
Luigi Palla
